# [ $GNOME_TERMINAL_SCREEN ] && open-workspace

#NOTE: This approach isn't perfect. Notably, if you're somewhere in the system directories
#for your container and you make a new tab, you'll end up elsewhere in /run/host in the new tab.
#You can fix this issue by adding the following to the end of the .bashrc file in your
#container's home directory:
#  cd $(echo $(pwd) | sed -e 's/\/run\/host*//g')
#
# But this only works if there's a match to wherever you are in the host system directory.
# Otherwise, your directory resets to your home.
